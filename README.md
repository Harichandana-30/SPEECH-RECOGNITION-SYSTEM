# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM

## About the Project

This is a generic, Python-based text summarization tool developed during an NLP internship. It reduces large text documents into concise, coherent summaries using state-of-the-art transformer models. Specifically, the tool utilizes the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face Transformers to generate high-quality, abstractive summaries that preserve the essential meaning of the original content.

This project was built to address a practical need: long articles, reports, and research papers are time-consuming to read. This tool enables users to quickly grasp the core ideas without reading every word.

## Features

- Accepts input from:
  - Manual text entry via the command line
  - External `.txt` files (plain text)
- Uses the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` pre-trained model for summarization
- Displays:
  - Original input text
  - Summarized output
  - Word count and compression ratio
- Optionally saves the summary to a `.txt` file

## Why This Was Built

This project was intended to go beyond theory and solve a real-world problem: how to efficiently process and understand large volumes of text.

Manual summarization is labor-intensive, especially for:

- Students
- Researchers
- Professionals

Automating this process using deep learning provides:

- Time savings
- Consistent and coherent summaries
- A foundation for future advanced NLP applications

It also served as a valuable learning experience in Natural Language Processing and transformer-based models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
